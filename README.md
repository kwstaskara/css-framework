We created pyramid ui because we wanted a framework that gives you choices about theming and browser support by default.


## Principles
Pyramid ui provides ui items that do not contain default colors,allowing users to pick the colors that want for theming.

Pyramid ui contains new css features but old features as well. Developers can choose between table,flexbox and css grid layout(coming soon css grid).
Built with Normalizer
